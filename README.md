# Analyzing_Twitch_Gaming_Data

![Hello](twitch-ar21.png)


Twitch is the world’s leading live streaming platform for gamers, with 15 million daily active users. 

In this project, I will be working with two tables that contain Twitch users’ stream viewing data and chat room usage data using SQL.

Stream viewing data:

- `stream` table

Chat usage data:

- `chat` table

And then I will visualize some data using Python.
